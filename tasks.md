# Tasks

## Task 1: Get to know your repo

Answer the following questions:

- A good start to understand the repo is to check the `package.json`. What is the HTTP server library used here? What development tools are configured? 
- What does the following scripts do? `dev`, `test`
- What is the entry point of the server?
- What do you think why is the `app.ts` and the `server.ts` is separated? 
- If you would create a new endpoint in which file would you put it?
- In the tests which method simulates the HTTP request?
- What do you think what does the `ts-node` package do?
